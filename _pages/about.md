I am passionate about systems programming, low-level programming, embedded systems, parallel computing, cloud computing, and distributed systems. I have completed internships and multiple projects in these fields.

I am also interested in areas such as security, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and network administration.

I hold an Engineering degree in Computer Science from ENSPY, Yaounde, Cameroun and a Master's degree in Cloud and Distributed Systems from Grenoble INP, ENSIMAG - Grenoble, France. 

I am currently pursuing a PhD in cloud computing applied to blockchain technology in University of bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.

I am open to new experiences and opportunities.
