excerpt: 'Peer sampling is a crucial primitive in distributed
systems, used to manage overlays and disseminate information in
large-scale scenarios such as permissionless blockchain systems.
Its purpose is to maintain and regularly update a local and
partial snapshot, or view, of the complete system’s membership.
These protocols are often targeted by malicious actors who
aim to disrupt higher-level protocols. Typically, an adversary
who controls a set of Byzantine nodes attempts to manipulate
how legitimate nodes perceive the presence of Byzantine ones
by increasing their representation in the view of honest nodes.
While state-of-the-art Byzantine-tolerant peer sampling protocols
mitigate this bias, their effectiveness decreases significantly as
the number of malicious nodes increases. This paper introduces
AUPE, the first collaborative Byzantine-tolerant peer sampling
protocol that leverages the presence of trusted nodes, such as
Intel’s SGX capable devices, to collaboratively track the spread
of identifiers in the system and locally debias the representation
of Byzantine nodes. Simulations with 10,000 nodes demonstrate
that AUPE outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving near-
perfect resilience even when faced with an adversary controlling
26% of the nodes. Overall, by including as few as 10% of trusted
nodes, AUPE increases the tolerance of B RAHMS by up to 60%
while limiting the impact of the adversary’s attack, even when
possessing up to 40% of the nodes.'
